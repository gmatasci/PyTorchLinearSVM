# PyTorchLinearSVM

## Implementation
Implements a simple Linear SVM (soft margin formulation) trained in PyTorch by gradient descent on a 2D toy dataset with binary labels. The hyper-parameter search (C parameter) is done by cross-validation via scikit-learn. It includes a visualization of the decision function and associated support vectors throughout the epochs of training for various C values.
